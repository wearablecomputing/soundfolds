# Sound Folds
Jan - Feb 2021

The goal of this project was to develop interactive garments for three musicians, playing the trumpet, cello and vibraphone. The garments are intended to be used in blended performance settings, combining acoustic instrument playing with interactive and responsive electronic music elements.

The project builds up on interactive technology that was developed by the Wearable Computing Group at Berlin University of the Arts and the Einstein Center Digital Future researchers. Folded textile sensor and garment technology were applied and further explored in this context.

The project brought together an interdisciplinary team of artists and engineers, spanning expertise in e-textiles, costume tailoring, and interactive music systems involving machine learning for gesture following.
